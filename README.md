CanOpen_Scala
=============

CanOpen protocol layer on the top of C libraries.
Written in an Actor style Reactive paradigm.

This is an initial release and it doesn't aim to be a full Stck with compliance but, as long as you need an higher level interface on a Can adapter free for use, this will be usefull.
